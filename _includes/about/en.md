Hey, I am Huang, Xuan (a.k.a. _@huxpro_). I worked on the [React Team](https://beta.reactjs.org/community/meet-the-team#react-core) at <del>Facebook</del>Meta.

I considered myself as a hybrid between a software engineer specifically into the programming languages theories and implementations domain (i.e. compiler, type system, type-based formal verification, virtual machine, runtime systems, garbage collection), and a creative technologiest deeply caring about many humanistic aspects (e.g. visual, sound, interaction) in UI and HCI in general.
